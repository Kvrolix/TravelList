## 📖 What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of React fundamentals and explore the following concepts:

1. **State Management**:
   - Using `useState` to handle dynamic data.
   - Ensuring immutability while updating state.

2. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Building reusable and modular components for scalability.

3. **Props and Component Communication**:
   - Passing data and functions between components effectively.

4. **Array Methods**:
   - Leveraging `map`, `filter`, and `sort` for dynamic data manipulation.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - Managing user interactions such as form submissions and button clicks.

6. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - Enhancing user feedback through dynamic content.
